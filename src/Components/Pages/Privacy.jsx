        <h1>Valve Privacy Policy</h1>
    <h2>1. Definitions</h2>
    <p>Wherever we talk about Personal Data below, we mean any information that can either itself identify you as an individual ("Personally Identifying Information") or that can be connected to you indirectly by linking it to Personally Identifying Information. Valve also processes anonymous data, aggregated or not, to analyze and produce statistics related to the habits, usage patterns, and demographics of customers as a group or as individuals. Such anonymous data does not allow the identification of the customers to which it relates. Valve may share anonymous data, aggregated or not, with third parties.</p>
    <p>Other capitalized terms in this Privacy Policy shall have the meanings defined in the Steam Subscriber Agreement ("SSA").</p>

    <h2>2. Why Valve Collects and Processes Data</h2>
    <p>Valve collects and processes Personal Data for the following reasons:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>a) where it is necessary for the performance of our agreement with you to provide a full-featured gaming service and deliver associated Content and Services;</li>
        <li>b) where it is necessary for compliance with legal obligations that we are subject to (e.g. our obligations to keep certain information under tax laws);</li>
        <li>c) where it is necessary for the purposes of the legitimate and legal interests of Valve or a third party (e.g. the interests of our other customers), except where such interests are overridden by your prevailing legitimate interests and rights; or</li>
        <li>d) where you have given consent to it.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>These reasons for collecting and processing Personal Data determine and limit what Personal Data we collect and how we use it (section 3. below), how long we store it (section 4. below), who has access to it (section 5. below) and what rights and other control mechanisms are available to you as a user (section 6. below).</p>

    <h2>3. The Types and Sources of Data We Collect</h2>
    <h3>3.1 Basic Account Data</h3>
    <p>When setting up an Account, Valve will collect your email address and country of residence. You are also required to choose a user name and a password. The provision of this information is necessary to register a Steam User Account. During setup of your account, the account is automatically assigned a number (the "Steam ID") that is later used to reference your user account without directly exposing Personally Identifying Information about you. We do not require you to provide or use your real name for the setup of a Steam User Account.</p>

    <h3>3.2 Transaction and Payment Data</h3>
    <p>In order to make a transaction on Steam (e.g. to purchase Subscriptions for Content and Services or to fund your Steam Wallet), you may need to provide payment data to Valve to enable the transaction. If you pay by credit card, you need to provide typical credit card information (name, address, credit card number, expiration date and security code) to Valve, which Valve will process and transmit to the payment service provider of your choice to enable the transaction and perform anti-fraud checks. Likewise, Valve will receive data from your payment service provider for the same reasons.</p>
