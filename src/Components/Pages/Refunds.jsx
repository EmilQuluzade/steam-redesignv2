        STEAM REFUNDS
        <br /><br />
        You can request a refund for nearly any purchase on Steam—for any reason. Maybe your PC doesn't meet the hardware requirements; maybe you bought a game by mistake; maybe you played the title for an hour and just didn't like it.
        <br /><br />
        It doesn't matter. Valve will, upon request via help.steampowered.com, issue a refund for any reason, if the request is made within the required return period, and, in the case of games, if the title has been played for less than two hours.
        <br /><br />
        There are more details below, but even if you fall outside of the refund rules we’ve described, you can ask for a refund anyway and we’ll take a look. Consumers in some jurisdictions may have additional rights to a refund in circumstances where the game is faulty.
      </p>
      <p> 
        You will be issued a full refund of your purchase within a week of approval. You will receive the refund in Steam Wallet funds or through the same payment method you used to make the purchase. If, for any reason, Steam is unable to issue a refund via your initial payment method, your Steam Wallet will be credited the full amount. (Some payment methods available through Steam in your country may not support refunding a purchase back to the original payment method. Click <a href="#">here</a> for a full list.)
      </p>
      <h2>Where Refunds Apply</h2>
      <p>
        The Steam refund offer, within two weeks of purchase and with less than two hours of playtime, applies to games and software applications on the Steam store. Here is an overview of how refunds work with other types of purchases.
      </p>
      <h3>REFUNDS ON DOWNLOADABLE CONTENT (DLC)</h3>
      <p>
        DLC purchased from the Steam store is refundable within fourteen days of purchase, and if the underlying title has been played for less than two hours since the DLC was purchased, so long as the DLC has not been consumed, modified or transferred. Please note that in some cases, Steam will be unable to give refunds for some third-party DLC (for example, if the DLC irreversibly levels up a game character). These exceptions will be clearly marked as nonrefundable on the Store page prior to purchase.
      </p>
      <h3>REFUNDS ON IN-GAME PURCHASES</h3>
      <p>
        Steam will offer a refund for in-game purchases within any Valve-developed games within forty-eight hours of purchase, so long as the in-game item has not been consumed, modified, or transferred. Third-party developers will have the option to enable refunds for in-game items on these terms. Steam will tell you at the time of purchase if the game developer has opted to offer refunds on the in-game item you are buying. Otherwise, in-game purchases in non-Valve games are not refundable through Steam.
      </p>
      <h3>REFUNDS ON PRE-PURCHASED TITLES</h3>
      <p>
        When you pre-purchase a title on Steam (and have paid for the title in advance), you can request a refund at any time prior to the release of that title. The standard 14-day/two-hour refund period also applies, starting on the game’s release date.
      </p>
      <h3>STEAM WALLET REFUNDS</h3>
      <p>
        You may request a refund for Steam Wallet funds within fourteen days of purchase if they were purchased on Steam and if you have not used any of those funds.
      </p>
      <h3>RENEWABLE SUBSCRIPTIONS</h3>
      <p>
        For some content and services, Steam offers periodic (e.g. monthly, yearly) access that you pay for on a recurring basis. If a renewable subscription has not been used during the current billing cycle, you may request a refund within 48 hours of the initial purchase or within 48 hours of any automatic renewal. Content is considered used if any games within the subscription have been played during the current billing cycle or if any benefits or discounts included with the subscription have been used, consumed, modified or transferred.
      </p>
      <p>
        Please note that you can cancel an active subscription at any time by going to your account details. Once cancelled, your subscription will no longer automatically renew but you will retain access to the content and benefits of the subscription through the end of your current billing cycle.
      </p>
      <h3>STEAM HARDWARE</h3>
      <p>
        Within the applicable time frame and process identified in the Hardware Refund Policy, you may request a refund for Steam hardware and accessories purchased via Steam.
      </p>
      <h3>REFUNDS ON BUNDLES</h3>
      <p>
        You can receive a full refund for any bundle purchased on the Steam Store, so long as none of the items in the bundle have been transferred, and if the combined usage time for all items in the bundle is less than two hours. If a bundle includes an in-game item or DLC that is not refundable, Steam will tell you if the whole bundle is refundable during check-out.
      </p>
      <h3>PURCHASES MADE OUTSIDE OF STEAM</h3>
      <p>
        Valve cannot provide refunds for purchases made outside of Steam (for example, CD keys or Steam wallet cards purchased from third parties).
      </p>
      <h3>VAC BANS</h3>
      <p>
        If you have been banned by VAC (the Valve Anti-Cheat system) on a game, you lose the right to refund that game.
      </p>
      <h3>VIDEO CONTENT</h3>
       <p> We are unable to offer refunds for video content on Steam (e.g. movies, shorts, series, episodes, and tutorials), unless the video is in a bundle</p>
    </p>
